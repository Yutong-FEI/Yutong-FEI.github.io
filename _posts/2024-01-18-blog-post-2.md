# Chapter 1 : Introduction to Large Language Models (LLM)


## The rise of LLMs in AI landscape
AI has performed well in data-driven tasks such as sentiment analysis, fraud detection and more. However, it traditionally lacked ability to understand context, respond to open-ended questions, and generate human-like responses in conversation. Recent developments in language-based AI models have led to a disruptive breakthrough. These models, called Large Language Models, can process language as humans do. 

LLMs use deep learning techniques to perform a variety of NLP (Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the technology that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. This technology is often employed in applications such as translation services and chatbots.) tasks such as text classification, summarization, generation and more.  

### Definitions of LLMs : 

Large : training data and resources 
Language : they are powerful in processing and analyze human language data
Models : Learn complex patterns using text data 

### The defining moment : 

The LLM is considered the defining moment. 
GPT series is one of the most popular language models among the family of LLMs, primarily because of its ability to engage in rich human interactions. 

### Applications :

Sentiment analysis, Identifying themes, Translating speech or text, Generating codes, Next-word prediction. 

### Objectives of this course

- Conceptual understanding of LLMs
- Training data considerations
- Ethical, privacy and environmental concerns
- wrap up this course by covering the enhancements and future work of LLMs 


## Real-world applications :
This section aims to understand business opportunities and benefits of leveraging LLMs. 

### Business opportunies
Benefits : Automate tasks, Improve efficiency, create revenue streams, enable new capacities. (自动化任务、提高效率、创造收入流、启用新能力。)

### Transforming finance industry

Financial analysis of a company can be complex and may include processing unstructured text such as investement outlooks, annual reports, new articles, and socia media posts. 

**Unstructured data or text** : data that lacks definition and is presented free-form. 
LLM can analyze such data to generate valuable insights into market trends, manage investments, and identify new investment opportunities. 

### Challenges in healthcare 

Analyzing health records is important for giving personalized recommendations to provide quality healthcare. But, much of thees information is in doctors' notes, which can be hard to understand because they use **jargon and abbrevations**. Further more, **domain specific-knowledge and varying writing styles** among practitioners add to the the challenges of interpreting this critical information effectively. Processing such varied data and understanding complex **acronyms** makes it difficult to have a general system to describe any patient files. 

### Revolutionizing healthcare sector 

- LLMs can analyze patient data to offer personalized recommendations : medical records, health check-out results, imaging reports, to provide personalized treatment recommendations. 
- Patient data is private and personnal, so anyone use LLM must adhere to privacy laws.

### Education 

- Personnalized coaching and feedback 
- Interactive learning experience
- AI-powered tutor can ask questions, recevie guidance, discuss ideas
- Moreover, the tutor can adapt its teaching style based on the learner's conceptual understanding.

### Multimodol applications of LLM 

Visual question answering : process both image and text data to generate responses. 

## Challenges of language modeling 


### Challenges of language modeling

1. **Sequence matters** : Modeling a language requires understanding the sequential nature of text, because placing even one word differently can change the meaning of the sentence completely.
2. **Context Modeling** : language is highly contextual, meaning the same word can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. To accurately model language, language models must analyze and interpret the surrounding words, phrases, and sentences to identify the most likely meaning of a given word.
3. **Long-range dependency**

### Single-task learning

For example : 

Task 1 model --> Question Answering 

Task 2 model --> Text Summarization 

Tasl 3 model --> Translation 

**Issues** : Time and resource expensive, less flexible compared to modern LLMs. 

### Multi-task Learning 

With the development of LLMs, multi-task learning has become possible. This involves training a model to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously of traing separate models for each task. 
<br/><img src='/images/multitask_datacamp.png'>

Advantages : 
1. (versatile) improved performance on each individual task (using new and unseen data, but may come at the expense of accuracy and efficiency 以牺牲准确性和效率为代价) 
2. Might impact accuray and efficiency
3. it can **decrease the training data** needed for each individual task by allowing the model to learn from shared data across the tasks. 它可以通过允许模型从跨任务的共享数据中学习来减少每个单独任务所需的训练数据。

# Chapter 2 : Building Blocks of LLMs 


## Novelty of LLMs 

- LLMs Use text data : unstrutured data (messy and inconsistent) 
- Issue : Machines do not understand languages !
- Need for NLP : Text data --> NLP --> Numerical form --> Enable computers to identify the patterns and features of text data
- Unique capabilities of LLMs : abilities to detect linguisitic subtleties like irony, humor, intonation and intents !

### How do LLMs understand ? 

1. Trained on vast amounts of data
2. Largeness of LLMs : parameters
3. Parameters represent the patterns and rules learnf from training data
4. More parameters allow for capturing more complex patterns, resulting in sophisticated and accurate responses

### Emergence of new capacities 

These massive parameters also give rise to LLMs' emergent capabilities
1. Emergent abilities : unique to large-scale models like LLMs and not found in smaller ones. 
2. Scale : it is defined by the volume of training data and the number of model parameters (As the scale increases, the model's performance can dramatically improve beyond a certain threshold, resulting in a phase transition and a sudden emergence of new capabilities 
<br/><img src='/images/threshold_llm.png'>

3. Applications :
Music, Poetry, Code generation, Medical diagnosis and treatment plans

### Buidling blocks of LLMs 

To reach this threshold, LLM and their parameters undergo a training process 
(**Text pre-processing, text representation, pre-training, fine-tuning, advanced fine-tuning.**)

### To recap

- We learned how LLMs overcome data's unstructured nature
- it outperform traditional models by comprehending complex linguistic subtleties and generating detailed responses

**HOW?** : 
- this performance boost is a result of the "largeness" of LLMs, which is due to extensive training data and many parameters.
- These factors also enable "emergent abilities", which unlock advanced capabilitie and expand LLMs' use cases, making them a potent tool in Natural Language Processing. 

## Generalized overview of NLP

Key NLP techniques used to prepare text data into machine-readable form for use in LLMs 

### Text pre-processing 

It transforms raw text data into a standardized format. 

**Steps** :  Tokenization, stop word removal and lemmatication 

1. Tokenization : splits text into individual words, or tokens. After tokenization, we obtain a **list**.
2. Stop word removal : stop words do not add meaning (like "as", "with" ,"is", etc)
3. Lemmatization : group slightly different words with similar meaning. It reduces words to their base form (talking--> talk, talked --> talk)

### Text representation

It help convert preprocessed text into a numerical form (bag-of-words, word embeddings) 

- bag-of-words : it involves converting the text into a matrix of word counts (limitations : it fails to capture the order or context, can lead to incorrect interpretations; it does not capture the semantics between the words, beacuse it treats related words as independent) 

- Word embeddings : capture the semantic meanings as numbers, allowing for similar words to have similar representations.

for example : features are "plant, furry, carnivore" 
- cat : [-0.9, 0.9, 0.9]
- mouse : [-0.8, 0.7, -0.8]
  
so cat is furry and carnivore; mouse is furry.

### Machine-readable form

Convert pre-processed text to numerical format : text data --> tokenization stop-word removal lemmatization --> bag of words / word embedding --> Numerical data

## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is an effective approche used to help LLMs overcome certain challenges 
Building these models requires powerful computers and specialized infrastructure due to the massive amounts of data and computational resources involved 

## Computing power 
- Memory
- Processing power
- infrastructure
- expensive
- LLM : 100,000 Central Processing Units (CPUs), 10,000 Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) 

### Efficient model training 
Chanllenges : significant training time, may take weeks or even months 

Efficient model training = faster training time

### Data availiability
- Needs of high-quality data
- to learn the complexities and subtleties of language
- A few hundred gibagytes (GBs) of text data (more than a million books)
- massive amount of data 

## Learning techniques 
Fine-tuning : training a pre-trained model for a specila task 

But, what if there is little to no labeled data ?但是，如果标记数据很少甚至没有怎么办？

N-shot learning : zero-short, few-short, and multi-short (theses techniques are part of transfer learning)

### Transfer learning : 
Learn from one task and transfer to related task (like transfering knowledge from piano to guitar)

N-shot leaning : 
* zero-shot - no task - specific data
* few-shot - little task - specific data
* multi-shot - relatively more training data 

### Zero-shot learning 
* it allows LLMs to perform a task it has not been explicitly trained on. 
* It uses its understanding of language and context to transfer its knowledge to the new task. 
* Generalizes without any prior examples 

### Few-shot learning 
* Learn a new task with a few examples 
When the number of examples used for fine-tuing is only one, it is called one-shot learning; 

### Multi-shot learning
* Requires more examples than few-shot 
* The model learn from previous tasks, plus new examples, 

**Advantages**
- This approach saves time and effort in collecting and labeling a large dataset 
- No compromise on accuracy 

### Building blocks so far 
- Data prepration workflow (how data is prepared for computers to understand language)
- Fine-tuning is an effective approach for overcoming the challenges of building LLMs. 
- N-shot learning techniques for dealing with the lack of data. 

# Training Methodology and Techniques 
## Building blocks to train LLMs 

**Pre-training** : next-word prediction, masked language modeling 

### Generative pre-training
LLMs are typically trained using a technique called generative pre-training 

Providing the model with a dataset of text tokens and training it to predict the tokens within it. 

Two types commonly used styles of generative pre-training are next word prediction and masked language modeling. 


### next word prediction

* Supervised learning technique : 
Model trained on input-output pairs

* Similarly, a next word prediction model is used to train a language model to predict the next word in a sentence, given the context of the words before it. 

* The model learns to generate coherent text by capturing the dependencies between words in the larger context. 

* Training data : pairs of input and output examples 


### Masked language modeling 
* Hides a selective word
* Trained model predicts the masked word

These techniques are used to learn the contextual representation of words. 


**Steps** : tokenization, word embedding, pre-training, fine-tuning 

## Introduction to transformers 

### What is a transformer ? 
Transformer architectures emphasizes long-range relationships between words in a sentence to generate accurate and coherent text. 

It has **4 essential components** : pre-processing, positional encoding ,encoders and decoders. 

### Inside the transformer 
- step 1 **Text pre-processing and representation + Positional encoding** : 

Text pre-processing --> tokenization, stopt word removal, lemmatization 

Text representation --> word embedding 

Positional encoding --> Information on the position of each word , Understand distant words 

the transformer pre-processes input text, converting it to numbers and incorporating position references (转换器预处理输入文本，将其转换为数字并合并位置引用) 

- step 2 **Encoders** : 

Attention mechanism : directs attention to specific words and relationships 

Neural network : process specific features 

the encoders uses this information to encode the sentence, which the decoder then uses to predict subsequent words. 

- step 3 **Decoders** : 

Includes attention and neural networks 

Generates the output 

the predicted word is added to the input, and the process continues until the final output completes the input sentence

### Transformers and long-range dependecies 

* Initial chanllenge : long-range dependency 
* The transoformer's attention mechanism overcomes this limitaion by focusing on different parts of the input 

### Process multiple parts simultaneously 
* Limitation of traditional language models : 
Sequential - one word at a time 

* Transformers 
Process multiple parts of the input text simultaneously, speeding up the process of understanding and generating text. 

## Attention Mechanisms

- Understand complex structures 
- Focus on important words 

for example, book reading analogy : clues in a mystery book, focus on relevant content and consentrate on crucial input data 


### Self-attention and multi-head attention 

- self-attention : weights the importance of each word in a sentence based on the context to capture long-range dependencies 

- Multi-head attention : next level of self-attention, splits input into multiple heads with each head focusing on diffenret aspects (多头注意力：下一个层次的自注意力，将输入分成多个头，每个头专注于不同的方面) 

### Multi-head attention advantages 
* "The boy went to the store to buy some groceries, and he found a discount on his favorite cereal" 

Attention : "boy", "store", "groceries", and "discount" 

**Self-attention** : "boy" and "he" --> same person; il also identifies the connection between "groceries" and "cereal" as related items within the store

**Multi-head attention** : multiple channels : 

one might focus on character ("boy"), Action ("went to the store", "found a discount"); things involved ("groceries", "cereals")

## Advanced fine-tuning

### Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) 

**Pre-training** : 

LLM : 
- LLMs are pre-trained on large amounts of text data from divers sources, like websites, books, and articles
- using transformer architecture. 
- Learns general language patterns, grammars, and facts 

Next word prediction 

Masked language modeling 

### Fine-tuning 

after pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using N-shot techniques (such as zero, few, and multi-shot) on small labeled datasets to learn specific tasks. 

### BUt, why RLHF ? 

* The concern is that the large general-purpose training data may contain : Noise, errors, and inconsistencies, reducing its accuracy in specific tasks 


for example, when a model is trained on data from online discussion forums, il will have a mix of unvalidated opinions and facts. The model treats this training data as the truth, therefore reducing the accuracy. RLHF introduces an external expert to validate the data and avoid these inaccuracies. 

### Start with the need to fine-tune 
* Pre-training : learns underlying language patterns; doesn't capture context-specific complexities 
* Fine-tuning : Quality labeled data improves performances 
* Enter RLHF : human feedback ! 

### Simplifying RLHF 

* Model output reviewed by human
* update model based on the feedback 

Steps : 
* Step 1 : Recevies a prompt, and generate multiple responses 
* Steps 2 : Human expert checks these responses, ranks the responses based on quality (accuracy, relevance, coherence)
* step 3 time for feedback : learns from expert's ranking, to align uts responses in future with their preferences 
* And it goes on : the model continues to generate responses, receive rankings from the expert, and learn. 

## Recap 
* Pre-training to learn general language knowledge, fine-tuning for specific tasks, RLHF techniques to enhance fine-tuning through human feedback, combination is hghly effective ! 


# Concerns and Considerations 
## Data concerns and considerations 

How LLM are changing the AI landscape, especially in how we use language, and summarized how they are constructed. 

- Data volume and compute power
- Data quality
- Labeling 
- bias
- Privacy 

### Data volume and computer power 

* LLMs need a lot of data : training one such model can cost millions of dollars worth of computational resources 

### Data quality 
* Quality data is essential 
* Accurate data = better learning = improved, response quality = increased trust 

### Labeled data 
* Correct data label : accurate learning, generalized patterns, accurate responses 
* Labor-intensive : ex. assigning correct label to each aricle 
* Incorrect labels impact model performance 
* address errors :identify --> analyze --> iterate 

### Data bias 
Ensuring bias free data is as important as its quality and accuracy for any model including LLMs 
* influenced by societal stereotypes 
* lack of diversty in training data 
* Discrimination and unfair outcomes 
* Spot and deal with the biased data : evaluated data imbalances, promote diversity, bias mitigation techniques (more diverse examples) 

### Data privacy 
The data mau contain sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) 
* Compliance with data protection and privacy regulations 
* Privacy is a concern : training on data without permission can lead to a breach 未经许可对数据进行训练可能会导致违规

## Recap : Where are LLMs heading ? 

### Model explainability
* How do they arrive at their outputs ? 
* Poad-trip planning 
* Build trust and transparency 
* Identifiy and correct the biases or errors 

### Efficiency 
* Computational efficiency : high-quality output with less compute 
* Faster and efficient : model compressions, optimization 
* Benefits : better storage, lower energy use 
* Accesibility and sustainability : Promotes green AI, Reduces operating costs 

### Unsupervised bias handling 
* Biased data --> discrimination 
* Handling bias in an unsupervised manner is an exciting area of research, that explores methods and techniques to detect and migrate biases automatically. 
* Unsupervised means that the LLM algprithm of the future would not need explicit human-labeled data; instead, it would autonomously identify and reduce biases by analzing patterns within the training data 
* Chanllenge : biases can be subtle and hard for algorithms to detect without human guidance, giving rise to the fear that new biased might get introduced in this process
