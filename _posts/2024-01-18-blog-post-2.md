Chapter 1 : Introduction to Large Language Models (LLM)
======

1 The rise of LLMs in AI landscape
======
AI has performed well in data-driven tasks such as sentiment analysis, fraud detection and more. However, it traditionally lacked ability to understand context, respond to open-ended questions, and generate human-like responses in conversation. Recent developments in language-based AI models have led to a disruptive breakthrough. These models, called Large Language Models, can process language as humans do. 

LLMs use deep learning techniques to perform a variety of NLP (Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the technology that allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. This technology is often employed in applications such as translation services and chatbots.) tasks such as text classification, summarization, generation and more.  

Definitions of LLMs : 
------
Large : training data and resources 
Language : they are powerful in processing and analyze human language data
Models : Learn complex patterns using text data 

The defining moment : 
------
The LLM is considered the defining moment. 
GPT series is one of the most popular language models among the family of LLMs, primarily because of its ability to engage in rich human interactions. 

Applications :
------
Sentiment analysis, Identifying themes, Translating speech or text, Generating codes, Next-word prediction. 

Objectives of this course
------
- Conceptual understanding of LLMs
- Training data considerations
- Ethical, privacy and environmental concerns
- wrap up this course by covering the enhancements and future work of LLMs 


2 Real-world applications :
======
This section aims to understand business opportunities and benefits of leveraging LLMs. 

Business opportunies
------
Benefits : Automate tasks, Improve efficiency, create revenue streams, enable new capacities. (自动化任务、提高效率、创造收入流、启用新能力。)

Transforming finance industry
------
Financial analysis of a company can be complex and may include processing unstructured text such as investement outlooks, annual reports, new articles, and socia media posts. 

**Unstructured data or text** : data that lacks definition and is presented free-form. 
LLM can analyze such data to generate valuable insights into market trends, manage investments, and identify new investment opportunities. 

Challenges in healthcare 
------
Analyzing health records is important for giving personalized recommendations to provide quality healthcare. But, much of thees information is in doctors' notes, which can be hard to understand because they use **jargon and abbrevations**. Further more, **domain specific-knowledge and varying writing styles** among practitioners add to the the challenges of interpreting this critical information effectively. Processing such varied data and understanding complex **acronyms** makes it difficult to have a general system to describe any patient files. 

Revolutionizing healthcare sector 
------
- LLMs can analyze patient data to offer personalized recommendations : medical records, health check-out results, imaging reports, to provide personalized treatment recommendations. 
- Patient data is private and personnal, so anyone use LLM must adhere to privacy laws.

Education 
------
- Personnalized coaching and feedback 
- Interactive learning experience
- AI-powered tutor can ask questions, recevie guidance, discuss ideas
- Moreover, the tutor can adapt its teaching style based on the learner's conceptual understanding.

Multimodol applications of LLM 
------
Visual question answering : process both image and text data to generate responses. 

Challenges of language modeling 
======
1. **Sequence matters** : Modeling a language requires understanding the sequential nature of text, because placing even one word differently can change the meaning of the sentence completely.
2. **Context Modeling** : language is highly contextual, meaning the same word can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. To accurately model language, language models must analyze and interpret the surrounding words, phrases, and sentences to identify the most likely meaning of a given word. 

Single-task learning
------
For example : 
Task 1 model --> Question Answering 
Task 2 model --> Text Summarization 
Tasl 3 model --> Translation 

Issues : Time and resource expensive, less flexible compared to modern LLMs. 

Multi-task Learning 
------
With the development of LLMs, multi-task learning has become possible.
