LLM courses' notes


Chapter 1 : Introduction to LongChain & Chatbot Mechanics
======

The LangChain ecosystem 
======
We now lived in a world where we're spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing large language models; of LLMs, for developping AI-powered applications. However, these LLMs differ based on their model architecture, training data, intended use cases, and prompting strategies. Additionally, these models ofter have to interact with other systems to retrieve data or monitor performance, which adds another layer of complexity.

What is LangChain ? 
======
Harrison Chase created LangChain in October 2022 to change all of that. It is an open-source framework for connecting : 
- LLMs
- data sources
- other functionality under a single unified syntax.

With LangChain, developpers can create scalable, modular LLM applications for almost any use. 

Objectives of this course 
======

LongChain encompasses an entire ecosystem of tools, but inthis course, we'll focus on : 
- core functionality of LangChain library.
- Chains and Tools for optimizing LLM output.
- Discussions on troubleshooting and evaluation techniques

LongChain is availiable in Python and JavaScript, but this course will only cover the Python version. 

Core components of LangChain 
======
1. a language model chosen by the developper (open-source models ou closed-source models)
2. prompts for tuning user inputs into model inputs
3. parsers and indexers for organizing data for easy retrieval.
4. chains and agents for creating workflows containing different components

Choose models
======
Hugging Face is huge repository of open source datasets, tools, and models ! 

Using language models hosted on Hugging Face is free, but using them in LangChain require a Hugging Face API token. 

**Creating a Hugging Face API Key** :
1. Sign up for a Hugging Face account
2. Navigate to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens]
3.
