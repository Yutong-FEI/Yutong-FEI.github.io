LLM courses' notes


Chapter 1 : Introduction to LongChain & Chatbot Mechanics
======

The LangChain ecosystem 
======
We now lived in a world where we're spoiled for choice when it comes to choosing large language models of LLMs, for developping AI-powered applications. However, these LLMs differ based on their model architecture, training data, intended use cases, and prompting strategies. Additionally, these models ofter have to interact with other systems to retrieve data or monitor performance, which adds another layer of complexity.

What is LangChain ? 
------
Harrison Chase created LangChain in October 2022 to change all of that. It is an open-source framework for connecting : 
- LLMs
- data sources
- other functionality under a single unified syntax.

With LangChain, developpers can create scalable, modular LLM applications for almost any use. 

Objectives of this course 
------

LongChain encompasses an entire ecosystem of tools, but inthis course, we'll focus on : 
- core functionality of LangChain library.
- Chains and Tools for optimizing LLM output.
- Discussions on troubleshooting and evaluation techniques

LongChain is availiable in Python and JavaScript, but this course will only cover the Python version. 

Core components of LangChain 
------
1. a language model chosen by the developper (open-source models ou closed-source models)
2. prompts for tuning user inputs into model inputs
3. parsers and indexers for organizing data for easy retrieval.
4. chains and agents for creating workflows containing different components

Choose models
------
Hugging Face is huge repository of open source datasets, tools, and models ! 

Using language models hosted on Hugging Face is free, but using them in LangChain require a Hugging Face API token. 

**Creating a Hugging Face API Key** :
1. Sign up for a Hugging Face account
2. Navigate to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Select new tokens and copy the key

To recap
------
- LangChain is a fantastic tool for working with natural languages.
- In the real world of development for production, it unlocks the ability for intelligent conversations with document and more abbilities for task automation, and different ways to analyze text data.
- it makes using AI easier and gives us greater control over the entire workflow. 
- Advantages of LangChain : it unifies the different models from different resources into a consistent, modular workflow.

Codes
------
LongChain has an `OpenAI class` and a `HuggingFaceHub class` for interacting with the respective APIs.

1. Hugging Face models in Langchain ! 

```ruby
from langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceHub

# Set your Hugging Face API token 
huggingfacehub_api_token = ' '

# Define the LLM
llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id='tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct', huggingfacehub_api_token=huggingfacehub_api_token)

# Predict the words following the text in question
question = 'Whatever you do, take care of your shoes'
output = llm.predict(question)
print(output)
```
2. OpenAI models in LangChain!

```ruby
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

# Set your API Key from OpenAI
openai_api_key = "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" 

# Define the LLM
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", openai_api_key=openai_api_key)

# Predict the words following the text in question
question = 'Whatever you do, take care of your shoes'
output = llm.predict(question)

print(output)
```

## Prompting strategies for chatbots

Use LangChain to start implementing prompting strategies for chatbots, this will aplly both OpenAI chat models and open-source chat models from Hugging Face.
