Yutong FEI is a Ph.D. student in Information and Communication Sciences at the Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (Department of Computer Science).

She obtained an engineer‚Äôs degree (equivalent to master) in Computer Science from the √âcole Centrale de Nantes in France and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Environmental Engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology in China. Following her studies in data science and her experiences as a data scientist developing algorithms to automatically understand text semantics, she became interested in semantic information extraction from text and knowledge representation, particularly in scientific information. Her doctoral thesis focuses on the study and classification of citation contexts (the text surrounding a reference) in multidisciplinary scientific articles, aiming to understand why and how an article is cited. This research involves providing a corpus of citation contexts annotated with different citation functions and decoding the citation semantics, to better analyze and understand the relationships between scientific articles through citations. This will help understand how citations contribute to the scientific discourse construction and the knowledge dissemination.
